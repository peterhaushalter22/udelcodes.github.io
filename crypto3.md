## W3lc0m3 t0 Day 3 of Crypt0 W33k!!

Today we will be learning about different operators and randomness in cryptography.  
Specifically, we will learn about thelogical operators, the boolean operators, the modulo operator, the XOR operator, 
randomness, and the one-time pad.

### Background on Logical Operators and the Modulo Operator

#### What is an Operator?

An operator is a symbol that stands for a mathematical function or action.  
Here are some familiar examples:  
- "**+**" --> addition operator
- "**-**" --> subtraction operator
- "**x**" --> multiplication operator

#### What is a Boolean Data Type?

Boolean data type is just a fancy way to describe True or False.  
The meaning of a boolean data type can only ever be True or False, 
although it may be represented in other forms.  
For example, booleans can be represented by numbers.  
In Cryptography, True is represented by the number 1 and False is represented by the number 0.
