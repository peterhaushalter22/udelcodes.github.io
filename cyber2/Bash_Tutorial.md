# Introduction to Bash!

## We will learn how to navigate a terminal by finding flags!
First we will go to the online terminal Alice and Bob provided yesterday: <a href="http://157.230.203.138/term" target="_blank">TERMINAL</a>

Begin by entering the following commands in the terminal...

1. `git clone https://github.com/alexarnell/Bash_Tutorial.git`
2. `cd Bash_Tutorial`
3. `cat cheat_sheet.txt`

Using this cheat sheet you are now unstoppable!

Now try and find all the flags 

Once you find a flag, input it in the answer box on <a href="https://learnification.fun/" target="_blank">Learnification.fun</a> under the module Week of Cyber Day 2! Good Luck!

**Total Number of Flags: 5**
