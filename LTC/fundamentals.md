# Get ready to learn the basics

Now that we've explored a bit of logic by using truth tables & and/or/xor/not, we can apply these ideas to some actual code! For our purposes today, we'll be using a language called **JavaScript**. According to BusinessInsider, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-popular-programming-languages-github-2019-11" target="_blank">JavaScript was *the* most popular programming language in 2019</a>, due to its versatility and usefulness when coding websites.

Although we'll be coding in JavaScript, the principles we'll be learning today can be applied to practically any programming language you can think of. Tomorrow, we'll look at some more JavaScript and add it to our website.

## Boolean Logic

Earlier today, we learned about **Boolean logic/ Boolean algebra**, where we had two inputs and used the operators **not, and, & or** to generate outputs. This is shown in the CodePen below.

If you go to the **JavaScript** tab on the CodePen above (it says "JS" and is to the right of the tab that says "CSS"), in the function called **updateBooleans()**, you can see where we perform that **boolean logic** to get our outputs!
