<p> We're so glad you're here, and we're so excited to teach you guys some new and exciting things, and we hope you're excited to learn!</p>
<h2> Why learn to code? </h2>
There are so many reasons to learn to code, here's just a few: 
<ul>
  <li>It's fun!</li>
  <li>It can help you solve some of the world's biggest problems</li>
  <li>Gain a better understanding of the world around you</li>
  <li>Have more career choices in the future</li>
  <li>You can create and build nearly anything you can imagine</li>
</ul>
Let's get started! 
<h2>Build your own website!</h2>

<h3> 1. Make a GitHub account</h3>

<p>If you already have a GitHub account, you can skip these steps and begin <b> Step 2. Make your own GitHub page</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>To make a GitHub account, first go to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" >github.com</a></li>
  <li>It should bring you to a page that says "Sign Up," but if you don't see that click the "Sign Up" button in the upper right corner</li>
  <li>Create a username, enter your email, and create a password</li>
  <li>Select your occupation, skill level, and interests from the menu it gives you. (This step doesn't matter too much) </li>
  <li>Log onto your email. GitHub should've sent you a confirmation email that includes a button that says "Verify Email Address". Click the button to verify your account</li>
  <li>The button should open up GitHub in your browser. You may need to re-enter your username/email and password. Once you've logged in, you're ready to code!</li>  
</ol>
  
<h3> 2. Make your own github page</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Create a new repository by clicking on the little triangle to the right of the <b>+</b> icon in the top right corner and selecting "New repository"</li>
  <li> Where it says "Repository name," enter YourUsername.github.io <br> <i>(If your username is electricKangaroo, you would name your repository electricKangaroo.github.io) </i><br></li>
  <li>Click on the button that says "Create New File" (it's been circled in the photo below) and name it "index.html" but don't put anything in it yet!</li>
  <li>Scroll to the bottom and click the green button that says "Commit new file"</li>
  </ol>

That's all for now, but keep this tab open since we'll come back to it later!

<h3>HTML</h3>
First, we'll learn about HTML so you can build your very own website!

#### Before we begin learning, let's check out some other websites and look at their HTML. 

In a new tab, open up any website that you like. 

Right click on the website, and click "view page source." This should open up another page, which will contain all of the HTML used to build that website. 

Look through their HTML. See if you can find places where it says **div, input, class, id, li,** or **button**

Once you've found some of those items, <a href="./introtohtml/index.html" target="_blank" >click here</a> to start learning how to write HTML code! 

Ready to write your own code? Go back into your <b>index.html</b> file in the GitHub repository we made earlier and start writing! <br>
If you need a little help,you can use the template found <a href="./template.html" target="_blank">here</a> to get started. Just open that file, then right click and hit "View page source", and copy and paste the contents of that file into your own <b>index.html</b> and change the content to say whatever you'd like! Feel free to add your own stuff in there, too!

#### Things to add to YOUR index.html
<div>
  <input type="checkbox">
  <label>Change the title of your page (found in the head)</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Change the header of your webpage</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox">
  <label>Add a link that links back to "http://www.udel.codes/LTC"</label><br> 
  <input type="checkbox">
  <label>Add a question that you have to the list of questions</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Add something that you learned to the list of things that you learned</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox">
  <label>Change one of the lists to be an **ordered** list</label><br> 
  <input type="checkbox">
  <label>Add a photo to your website!</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Add a **paragraph** element and introduce yourself in it!</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox">
  <label>Add a user input with any type of your choosing!</label><br>
</div>

Now that you've add all of this cool content, let's add some color and style to it! We'll do this using **CSS**!
