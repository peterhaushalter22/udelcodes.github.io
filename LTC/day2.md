Today we're going to learn a <b>bit</b> about logic!
We use logic all the time, even if you don't realize it. 

Let's say you're getting ready to leave for the day, and you're deciding what to take with you for the day.

If it's raining, and you plan on walking, you would bring an umbrella, but if you don't have to walk (or it's not raining), then you would not bring an umbrella. This can be represented with a truth table!

| I have to walk | It's raining | Bring an umbrella |
|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| No             | No           | No                |
| No             | Yes          | No                |
| Yes            | No           | No                |
| Yes            | Yes          | Yes               |

The table above can also be represented using 0's and 1's (0 is no/false, and 1 is yes/true). In the scenario, imagine A is having to walk, B is if it's raining, an O (output) is whether or not you need to bring an umbrella.

| A | B | O |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

Now try to match the following tables with the given scenarios!

Scenario 1: <br>

  A is if you took notes in class <br>
  
  B is if you studied for the test
  
  O is if you pass the class or not 
  
  You will pass the test if you either study or took notes, or both
  
Scenario 2:
