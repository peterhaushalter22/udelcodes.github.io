# Intro to bash 
In the Cyber House, Alice and Bob have created an "Intro To Bash" training grounds, but they suspect that it has been infiltrated by the l33k3rs. However, they don't have any proof.

# Web infiltration
The l33k3rs have also infiltrated the main desert database and have added leeks to all of the dessert recipes! They have defaced the main website with the l33k3rs name.

Alice and Bob have collected the photographic evidence [here](https://udel.codes/cyber2/web-evidence.html). 

The **Global Desert Vault** developers have provided us with a sample copy of their website. They suspect that an old, unprotected file upload page is the culprit, but they can't figure out how the l33k3rs managed to use the page to deface the main website. 

Take a look and see what you and the rest of the team can learn from the file upload page [here](http://desserts.gel.webfactional.com/).
