# Think and do like the enemy 

To take down the l33k3rs, we need to be able to think like they do, and be able to do what they can do.

# Intro to bash 
In the Cyber House, Alice and Bob have created an "Intro To Bash" training grounds, but they suspect that it has been infiltrated by the l33k3rs. However, they don't have any proof. 

Access the training grounds [here](https://udel.codes/cyber2/Bash_Tutorial) to begin the training and find proof that the l33k3rs have infiltrated the training grounds.

# Web infiltration
The l33k3rs have also infiltrated the main desert database and have added leeks to all of the dessert recipes! They have defaced the main website with the l33k3rs name.

Alice and Bob have collected the photographic evidence here (link to photographic proof).

The **Global Desert Vault** developers have provided us with a sample copy of their database. They suspect that an old, unprotected file upload page is the culprit, but they can't figure out the l33k3rs managed to use the page to deface the main website. 

Take a look and see what you and the rest of the team can learn from the file upload page here (link to page).
