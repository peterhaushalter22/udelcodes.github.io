<h1> Networks Day 1 </h1>

Our desire to communicate is strong. When we have to communicate with technology, it's weird. We as people will do all of the
technological innovation in the world to tell mom we love her.

We learned to talk.

We painted caves (the first instaflex).

We told stories that were memorized and passed on from generation to generation.

We learned to write so we could hand those stories to someone, and deliver them by boat, camel, horse, etc (the first blogs).

We communicated by smoke signals between tribes (the first cellies).

We wrote into stone, paper, hides, and even ropes (the first to-do lists).

We wrote letters (the first e-mails).

We created laws (the first protocols).

We shared culture, intentionally and not (the first memes).

We invented the printing press (the first internet).

We wrote plays and performed them (the first YouTube).

We painted pictures (the first selfies).

We invented puppets (the first cartoons).

We wrote music onto paper (the first mp3s).

We conducted symphonies (the first Spotify).

We invented the telegraph (the first phone line).

<h3> Now let's take a look at how people first communicated over a long distance instantaneously </h3>

<h3> Now we will try to talk to each other using morse code! Yay so fun!! </h3>

![morse code](images/morse-code.png)

** Put some background on what morse code is / how it's useful

** Heart language game
--> Insert streaming instructions for minecraft here

** Develop our own script for the minecraft people / talk them through it and demonstrate example

<h3> Now Imagine Multiple People Want to Talk at the Same Time </h3>

Aloha Net was based in Hawaii where they had to communicate between islands. The Aloha Net Protocol was developed so people could
communicate from two different islands without being interrupted by someone else.

** Radio Example

<h3> Noisy Channel </h3>


<h3> Now let's all try to make our own protocol for the noisy channel! </h3>

<h3> Let's go back to minecraft and see if our protocol works there too! </h3>
